    The manufacturing of baked goods is a precise biochemical process. Below are the key stages and their critical control parameters:

    **1. Mixing & Ingredient Addition**
    - **Purpose:** Hydrates dry ingredients and develops gluten structure.
    - **Equipment:** Horizontal or Spiral Mixer
    - **Key Control Parameters:**
        - `mixing_time_min`: Under-mixing results in poor gluten development; over-mixing causes dough breakdown.
        - `mixing_speed_rpm`: Impacts mechanical energy input and dough temperature rise.
        - `ingredient quantities (flour_kg, water_kg, etc.)`: Precise ratios are critical. Water temperature is often used to control final dough temp.

    **2. Fermentation (Bulk Fermentation)**
    - **Purpose:** Yeast consumes sugars, producing CO‚ÇÇ (for volume) and organic compounds (for flavor).
    - **Equipment:** Fermentation Cabinet or Room
    - **Key Control Parameters:**
        - `fermentation_time_min`: Directly impacts flavor profile and gas production.
        - `fermentation_temp_c`: Ideal range is 27-30¬∞C. Higher temperatures accelerate activity.

    **3. Proofing (Final Proof)**
    - **Purpose:** Final rise of the shaped dough before baking.
    - **Equipment:** Proofing Cabinet
    - **Key Control Parameters:**
        - `proofing_time_min`: Must be optimized. Under-proofed bread is dense; over-proofed bread collapses.
        - `proofing_temp_c`: Typically 35-40¬∞C with high humidity (~80% RH) to prevent skin formation.
        - `proofing_rh_percent`: (Simulated in our model) Humidity control is critical.

    **4. Baking**
    - **Purpose:** Sets the structure, creates crust, develops flavor via Maillard reaction, and ensures food safety.
    - **Equipment:** Multi-zone Tunnel Oven
    - **Key Control Parameters:**
        - `baking_time_min`: Determines moisture evaporation and final weight.
        - `baking_temp_c`, `oven_zone1_temp_c`, `zone2_temp_c`, `zone3_temp_c`: Modern ovens have different temperature zones.
            - **Zone 1 (High Heat):** Causes "oven spring" - rapid expansion.
            - **Zone 2 (Moderate Heat):** Sets the crumb structure.
            - **Zone 3 (Lower Heat):** Develops color and flavor.

    **5. Cooling**
    - **Purpose:** Allows moisture to redistribute and the structure to set before packaging.
    - **Equipment:** Cooling Conveyor
    - **Key Control Parameters:**
        - `cooling_time_min`: Prevents condensation in packaging, which causes mold.
        - `cooling_temp_c`: Ambient or controlled temperature.

    st.subheader("2. Definition of Final Product Quality")
    st.markdown("""
    Product quality is quantitatively defined based on measurable attributes:

    - **Core Temperature (`core_temp_c`):** Must reach a minimum of **92-99¬∞C** to ensure starch gelatinization is complete and the product is safe for consumption. *Measured by a thermocouple probe.*

    - **Weight Deviation (`weight_deviation`):** Measures evaporation loss during baking. An ideal batch has **< 2%** deviation from the target input weight. *Measured by a checkweigher.*

    - **Color Score (`color_score`):** Quantifies crust browning from the Maillard reaction. Scored from 0-100, with >90 being the target for premium products. *Measured by a machine vision system or colorimeter.*

    - **Overall Quality Score (`quality_score`):** A composite, weighted index (0-100) derived from the above parameters. **Scores below 60 indicate a process anomaly.**

    st.subheader("3. Justification of Data Streams & Parameters")
    st.markdown("""
    The selected process parameters are standard data streams collected by PLCs and SCADA systems in modern bakeries:
    - **Raw Material Quantities:** Tracked via load cells in ingredient silos and hoppers. Deviations indicate dosing errors or supplier inconsistency.
    - **Time & Speed Parameters:** Controlled by the recipe management system (e.g., SAP ME).
    - **Temperature Parameters:** Measured by RTD sensors and thermocouples throughout the process. Critical for controlling biochemical reactions.
    - **Quality Data:** Captured by inline sensors (checkweighers, vision systems) at the end of the line.
